# Quantitative Spatial Model (QSM) for Japan

This repository contains code for analyzing spatial economic patterns in Japan using a Quantitative Spatial Model (QSM) based on Allen and Arkolakis (2014).

## Overview

The QSM Japan project analyzes spatial economic patterns across Japanese municipalities from 1975 to 2010. The model estimates productivity and amenities for each location based on observed population and wage data, allowing for analysis of spatial economic patterns over time.

## Data

The analysis uses the following data:
- Population data for Japanese municipalities (1970-2010)
- Average wage data for Japanese municipalities (1975-2014)
- Spatial data (shapefiles) for Japanese municipalities
